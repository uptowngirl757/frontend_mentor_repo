### What I learned

I was on a course i saw online, a free resource for learning to "write CSS that does'nt break the responsiveness of the web" and I got to apply what I'd been learning with the max-height and min-height CSS code sinppets below. I'm really proud of myself âœ¨.

```css
.qr-code-img {
  width: 100%;
  max-height: 600px;
}
.container {
  min-height: 60vh;
  display: flex;
}
```

### Continued development

I really need to work on using mobile first CSS without writing any media queries. CSS that is responsive just by default. I still struggle with that, like A LOT.
